When you have multiple objects (key-value pairs taht are probably coming from back-end) this simple app
will make it possible to handle all the state of arbitrary number of input elements and change them accordingly.
Then you can use the final state to do something (maybe save new data to back-end).
Index.tsx page has logic for displaying state before and after and the Input.tsx page.
Input.tsx page has logic for actually storing the states and changing them.
